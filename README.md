# Finite-Differential-Analysis-for-Solving-Heat-Diffusion-in-a-2D-System

This project is related to the NUS PC3236 - Computational Methods in Physics

Due to the rapid advancement of technology, heat conduction has become the fundamental process that occurs in diverse engineering applications such as materials science, biomedical engineering, and thermal sciences. Using the existence of 2D heat conduction equations, we could better understand how the heat transfers within the solid materials via steady-state or non-steady-state phenomenon via modeling to gain valuable insights about the temperature profiles and thermal behavior under the different boundary conditions. 

As the finite difference method is a popular approach in solving numerical applications, this project will explore using the central finite difference method that integrates with several iterative solvers such as Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR), to solve the 2D heat diffusion equation and also comparing their accuracy and computational efficiency. The correctness of the solutions will be assessed by grid refinement studies and stability studies, particularly for explicit method.
